A proof-of-concept minimal implementation (wrapping the library) can be found in [`cmd/toverstok/`](./cmd/toverstok/README.md).

**eduP2P is currently in the proof-of-concept stage**, no fully fledged clients exists yet, but there is a working
terminal-based development program in `cmd/toverstok/`, as mentioned above.
